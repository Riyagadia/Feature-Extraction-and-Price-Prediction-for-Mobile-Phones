We objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a mobile phone based on its features. To achieve this, we'll perform a feature extraction analysis to identify the most influential features.
Handle outliers, or inconsistencies in the dataset, 
Perform feature extraction to identify the most relevant features that strongly affect the price of mobile phones.
Use statistical methods, visualizations, or feature importance techniques : e.g., correlation analysis
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Develop a machine learning model for price prediction.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean absolute error, root mean squared error) to assess how accurately it predicts mobile phone prices.
